A project made to practice Software Engineering principles using Golang.
It includes methodologies, documentation, diagramming, logging, i18n and
Test-Driven Development.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Golang
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Modeling**: PlantUML
* **Methodology:** Hybrid methodology with Waterfall planning + Scrum/XP execution
  * The requirements, design and modeling are written following the cascade methodology
  * After the design is ready, the implementation is done using Scrum user
  stories and XP practices such as clean code and TDD

## Current Status: 2. Design & Modeling

* [x] 1. System Requirements
* [/] 2. System Diagramming and Data Modeling
* [] 3. Documentation & API Spec
* [] 4. Implementation applying Clean Code & SOLID principles
* [] 5. Observability & Testing.

## Project Structure

* `docs/requirements/`: contains the functional and non functional
requirements, and the project constrains
* `docs/diagrams/`: PlantUML source files for the diagrams
* `docs/architecture/`: contains the architecture documentation
* `src/`: Go source code
